# Rulers

A Rack-based Web Framework built to learn more about the internal workings of Rails.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rulers'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rulers

## Usage

This gem is not intended to be used. It is a library I am building to gain a deeper understanding of the internal workings of Rails and similar Rack-based web frameworks.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
